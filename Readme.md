# Transforming Adversarial Samples to Clean Samples

## 1. Overview

This project presents a comprehensive and unified defense framework against adversarial attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs). While DNNs have achieved remarkable success across various domains, they remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial samples that are often imperceptible to humans but can deceive classifiers. Existing defense mechanisms often focus exclusively on either detection or purification, show poor generalization across different attack types, or significantly degrade performance on clean inputs.

To address these challenges, this framework integrates both detection and purification into a single, robust pipeline, designed to maintain high accuracy on unperturbed inputs while effectively identifying and neutralizing malicious inputs.

The key contributions of this work are:
* **A Unified Framework:** A seamless integration of a detection module and a purification module.
* **Advanced Adversarial Detector:** A novel dual-manifold detector that uses Bayesian uncertainty estimation through Monte Carlo dropout to model distinct manifolds for clean and adversarial features. This enables reliable identification of malicious inputs without the sensitivity issues of traditional kernel density estimation methods.
* **High-Level Feature Guided Denoiser (HFGD):** A sophisticated denoising autoencoder trained on multiple attack types (including FGSM, PGD, and BIM) that performs reconstruction in feature space rather than pixel space. This, combined with perceptual loss functions, allows for more effective preservation of semantic content during purification.

## 2. Methodology

The proposed defense system is a two-stage pipeline consisting of a **Detector Module** followed by a **Purifier Module**. The system first identifies potentially adversarial inputs and then selectively purifies them before they reach the classifier, minimizing performance degradation on clean samples.

### 2.1. Detector Module

The detector distinguishes adversarial examples from clean ones by leveraging manifold-based statistical distances and predictive uncertainty.

* **Deep Feature Extraction:** Semantic features are extracted from the penultimate layer of a pre-trained classifier.
* **Dual-Manifold Distance Estimation:** The core of the detector models distinct manifolds for clean and adversarial features in the deep feature space. It estimates separate multivariate Gaussian distributions for each class from both clean and adversarial samples. The Mahalanobis distances to these clean and adversarial manifolds are then used to compute a dual-manifold score for a given input.
* **Uncertainty Estimation:** Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is used at test time to perform multiple stochastic forward passes and quantify the predictive uncertainty, which tends to be higher for adversarial examples.
* **Classifier:** A logistic regression classifier is trained on a feature vector composed of the dual-manifold score and the uncertainty score to label inputs as either clean or adversarial.

### 2.2. Purifier Module

The purifier module is a denoising autoencoder based on a **DUNET architecture**, which extends U-Net with lateral connections between its encoder and decoder paths. This module, referred to as a High-level Representation Guided Denoiser (HGD), replaces the traditional pixel-level loss with a feature-reconstruction loss. This loss is calculated on the feature activations from a pre-trained target network, encouraging the preservation of semantic content.

## 3. Adversarial Attacks Evaluated

The framework was tested against several common gradient-based adversarial attacks:

* **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM):** A single-step white-box attack that uses the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input to create a perturbed example.
* **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD):** A strong, iterative variant of FGSM that performs multiple steps of gradient ascent while keeping the perturbation within a predefined bound.
* **Basic Iterative Method (BIM):** Another iterative extension of FGSM that applies the attack multiple times with a small step size. Both an early-stopping variant (BIM-A) and a complete iteration variant (BIM-B) were considered.

## 4. Experimental Setup

### 4.1. Datasets

Two standard benchmark datasets were used for evaluation:
* **MNIST:** A dataset of 70,000 grayscale images ($28\times28$ pixels) of handwritten digits (0-9). It is split into 60,000 training and 10,000 test images.
* **CIFAR-10:** A dataset of 60,000 color images ($32\times32$ pixels) across 10 object classes. It is divided into 50,000 training and 10,000 test images.

### 4.2. Classifiers

* **MNIST Classifier:** A lightweight CNN with two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and dropout, and two fully connected layers.
* **CIFAR-10 Classifier:** A deeper CNN comprising multiple convolutional blocks with batch normalization, max-pooling, and dropout, followed by three fully connected layers.

The dual-manifold detector with dropout consistently achieved high ROC-AUC scores, outperforming other methods and proving effective at distinguishing adversarial inputs from clean data. The detector was evaluated using 1,000 adversarial and 1,000 clean samples for each attack type.

### 5.2. Purifier Performance

The High-Level Guided Denoiser, using a **feature-wise loss** (from the `Pre-FC2` layer for MNIST and `Pre-FC3` for CIFAR-10), demonstrated significant improvements in classification accuracy on purified adversarial images.

**Denoised Accuracy on MNIST (Pre-FC2 Features)**

| **BIM-B** | 0.9864 | 0.1308 | 0.9803 |

**Denoised Accuracy on CIFAR-10 (Pre-FC3 Features)**

The experiments highlighted that pixel-wise loss functions fail to recover performance on complex datasets like CIFAR-10, underscoring the importance of semantically meaningful, feature-based loss functions.
